# FastAPI Keycloak Integration

---


Welcome to `fastapi-keycloak`. This projects goal is to ease the integration of Keycloak (OpenID Connect) with Python, especially FastAPI. FastAPI is not necessary but is
encouraged due to specific features. Currently, this package supports only the `password` and the `authorization_code`. However, the `get_current_user()` method accepts any JWT
that was signed using KeycloakÂ´s private key.

## Docs

Refer to [https://fastapi-keycloak.code-specialist.com/](https://fastapi-keycloak.code-specialist.com/).

Adding some features:
 - KeycloakToken with more datas (refresh token, expires_in, etc.)
 - KeycloakRefreshToken represents the response after refresh token
 - KeycloakGroup with field `attributes`
 - Function to retrieve groups by attribute
 - Update call api GET (for users and groups) with param briefRepresentation as false. This allows to get the full representation of the object.
 - Update create_user and create_group
 - Function to refresh token
 - Override user_login to take an account more details

This exposes all fastapi_keycloak features under fastapi_keycloak_extended.
